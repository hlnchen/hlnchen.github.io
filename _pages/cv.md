# Work Experience
* Data Scientist Intern at [Outreach.io](https://www.outreach.io)
  - Drive the project from 0 to 1 with product managers as the main stakeholder. Define the technical problem, draft the technical design document, conduct experiments and write production-level code.
  - Collect, validate and analyze \emph{million-level} complicated and dirty data with distributed computing framework. Collaborate with multiple teams and design the annotation protocols of the project.
  - Build domain-specific NLP models to solve the underlying business problem.
  - *Championship* in Outreach Hackathon: Prototype topic classification, topic-based sentiment analysis, and summarization with business email/meeting data to monitor the history of deals.
