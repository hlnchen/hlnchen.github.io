This is Haolin Chen's personal website. I am a 3rd year applied math PhD student who is fortunate to be advised by Prof. Luis Rademacher.

## Research interests
I study the mathematical foundation of machine learning and data sciences, solving and explaining problems via different tools in math, such as convex/nonconvex optimization, and tensor decomposition. Currently my focus is to develop provable and efficient algorithm for learning high dimensional Gaussian mixture models.

I also have broad interests in both theoretic and practical machine learning or deep learning problems, especially the mathematical interpretation of deep neural networks.
