This is Haolin Chen's personal website. I am a PhD candidate in applied math who is fortunate to be advised by Prof. Luis Rademacher.

## Research interests
I study the mathematical foundation of machine learning and data sciences. Currently my focus is to develop provable and efficient algorithm for learning high dimensional Gaussian mixture models.

I also have broad interests in both theoretic and practical machine learning or deep learning problems, especially the mathematical interpretation of deep neural networks.
