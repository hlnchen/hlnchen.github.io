This is Haolin Chen's personal website. I am a PhD candidate in applied math who is fortunate to be advised by Prof. Luis Rademacher.

## Research interests
I study the mathematical foundation of machine learning and data sciences. I am interested in the learning representation of data, especially in high dimension.

## News
I will be teaching MAT135A for the Fall quarter. My office hour is 4pm-5pm every Thursday.

I join [Outreach.io](https://www.outreach.io) as a data scientist from July to the end of 2021!
