## Ongoing projects
### Provable tensor methods in high dimensional statistics and latent variable model learning, Spring 2019-Ongoing
Advisor: Luis Rademacher, Professor of Mathematics, UC Davis. 

I study the problem of learning a high-dimensional Gaussian mixture model, under minimum additional assumptions. I am developing a provable and efficient algorithm of learning Gaussian mixture model, with application to latent variable models, using techniques combining overcomplete tensor decomposition, sum-of-squares proof system, and nonconvex optimization.

## Previous projects

### Optical properties of PT-symmetric systems,Winter 2015-Spring 2017
Advisor: Jing Chen,Professor of Physics,Nankai University.

Conducted numerical simulation of optical properties, such as Zitterbewegung effects, in PT-symmetric lattices model. These results provided numerical evidence of novel phenomena in optical lattice whose properties such as reflection rate are carefully manually adjusted. The research leads to discoveries in Moire lattice,and influenced the research in PT-symmetric optical system.

### Manifold learning and dimensionality reduction algorithms, Fall 2016 - Spring 2017
Advisor: Chunlin Wu,Professor of Mathematics,Nankai University.

Studied both linear and non-linear manifold learning and implemented various dimensionality reduction algorithms on both synthetic and real-life datasets and tested their robustness against noise or adversarial attack.
